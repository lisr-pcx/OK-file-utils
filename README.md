**O**verrated **K**it file utils is a collection of scripts for manipulation and analysis of files and documents.

For a list of available features please refer to **Usage** section.

## Installation

Make sure to have Python installed. All scripts have been developed using *Python 3.11.10*.

## Usage example

python3 OK_file_SCRIPTNAME.py -h

### OK-file-utils-cr-finder.py

List the occurence of a pattern (i.e. Change Request codes) from select files inside a directory.  

To search inside a directory:

```sh
python3 OK_file_utils_pattern_finder.py YOURFOLDER
```

To search and compare between two directories:

```sh
python3 OK_file_utils_pattern_finder.py YOURFIRSTFOLDER YOURSECONDFOLDER
```

Adding `-o` or `--ouput` will store the result in a file named *report.txt*:

```sh
python3 OK_file_utils_pattern_finder.py YOURFIRSTFOLDER YOURSECONDFOLDER --output
```

The pattern and the extension of the files are defined by regex, and they can be customized inside the script.  
In the example below it look for files "*.c", "*.h", "*.txt" that contain text with an identification codes for change request like atvcm1201, atvcm1202 ...

```python
re_file_ext = r'^.*\.(c|h|txt)$'
re_CR_format = r'(atvcm[0-9]+){1,}'
```
